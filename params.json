It is intended to help humans trade by providing card prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nDouble click trade_helper.exe to run the helper!\r\n\r\nNow simply hover a card in MTGO and it will show an additional popup with the price!\r\n\r\nHot Keys\r\n- CTRL+ALT+X = exit\r\n- CTRL+ALT+R = reload data files\r\n- CTRL+ALT+C = copy card and price data for spreadsheet\r\n- CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+C = copy card name\r\n- CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+O = open card text file\r\n\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\nDo I need to enter my username and password into the settings?\r\n- No, you simply login to your account as you normally would, then start MTGO Trade Helper.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n- Once MTGO Trade Helper finds the yellow popup on the screen it saves it as an image, then uses ImageMagick to make it larger, and Tesseract to convert it to text.\r\n\r\nWhere do the prices come from?\r\n- Price data is stored in CardsMTGO3.txt.  The prices are from MTGOLibrary.com.  You can get their latest price list by subscribing to their bot.\r\n\r\nThe card name was read incorrectly, how can I fix it?\r\n- Press CRTL+ALT+SHIFT+C to copy the incorrectly read card name into your clipboard.  Open data/cards.txt and enter the correct name, followed by a | (pipe symbol), then paste the incorrect name.\r\n\r\nThe edition was not read, how can I fix it?\r\n- Press CRTL+ALT+SHIFT+O to open the card text.  Find the edition text and copy it to your clipboard.  Open data/editions.txt and enter the correct name, followed by a | (pipe symbol), then paste the incorrect name.\r\n\r\nThe price was not read, how can I fix it?\r\n- The only reason this should happen is if the card name and edition are not found in the data/prices.txt file.  Check the card name and edition carefully.\r\n\r\nI updated my data files, can I share those with others?\r\n- Yes, this is one of the reasons I made the project open source.
